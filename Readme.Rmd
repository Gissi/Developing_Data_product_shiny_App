This is an R Markdown document for simple explanation of the shiny app created for the Developing data products course in the data science specialization track on coursera. 

The basic idea of the app is that you can change the upper slider on the left to select the numbers of observations wanted to plot the 
reggression on along with the lower slider to change the numbers of observations viewed in the data table below the graph. 

initally I created an app focusing on english premier league fantasy football data. The app worked fine when I ran it on my computer with runApp("url",display.mode="showcase") but for some reasons it did not work when I deployed it to shinyapps.io I was unable to find out why it does not work when deployed to shinyapps.io. 

Therefore I created similar app but used built in data that seems to work fine.I hyperlinked the code for the other app in this app and my slideshow will talk a litle about it. But for the purpose of this project I made this app to demnonstrait knowledge of basic shiny things. 

Feel free to let me know how to deploy the fantasy football app if you have time all the code is linked in this app on my github page. 

package needed for the app to run properly are shiny, ggplot2 and datasets
