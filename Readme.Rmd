This is an R Markdown document for simple explanation of the shiny app created for the Developing data products course in the data science specialization track on coursera. 

initally I created an app focusing on english premier league fantasy football data. The app worked fine when you run it in you computer with runApp("url",display.mode="showcase") but for some reasons that I was unable to find out it does not work when deployed to shinyapps.io. 

Therefore I created similar app but used built in data that seems to work fine.I hyperlinked the other app in this app and my slideshow will talk a litle about it. But for the purpose of this project I made this app to demnonstraigth knowledge of basic shiny things. 

Feel free to let me know how to deploy the fantasy football app if you have time all the code is linked in this app on my github page. 

package needed for the app to run properly are shiny, ggplot2 and datasets
